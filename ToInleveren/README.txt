	Implementation
We had frequent Skype meetings where we implemented the work together, taking turns programming over TeamViewer.
The vast majority of work was done with all participants present, with one occasionally missing due to other responsibilities.

	Assignments
We finished implementing assignments E1, E3, E5, E6 and M6.
Once the program has started up, holding [LCTRL] shows the controls. They are as follows:
Press [R] to toggle the movement of the lights 	(E1: Multiple light sources, with variable colors and movement)
Press [T] to toggle Cell Shading				(E3: Cell shading)
Press [U] to toggle Color Filtering				(E5: Simple color filter)
Press [J] to toggle Gaussian Blur				(E6: Gaussian blur)
Press [I] to toggle Bloom						(M6: Bloom)

Additionally, the [WASD]-keys support movement along the XZ-plane and [LSHIFT + SPACE] along the Y-axis.

	References
We used information from the following webpages for the following assignments:

The rest of the assignments were made using only the hints in the assignment.
